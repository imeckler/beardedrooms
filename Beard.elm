{- for now, assume the display tree
is the same as tree that represents the semantics
of which objects descend from which for purposes
of moving whole subtrees around, folding whole subtrees
away, etc. But these might be separated if the user
wants to move a box around on the screen without
changing its parent and children. -}

{- i changed my mind back to beards
being just a single DisplayTree. this 
avoids duplicating code and it provides a 
neat solution to rooms with multiple roots:
that room corresponds to a single db object
that displays invisibly and has as children
the would-be roots.-}
